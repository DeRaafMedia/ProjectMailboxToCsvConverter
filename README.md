ProjectMboxToCsvConverter
=========================

Just a simple Python script that makes it easier for me personally to archive my mail into csv files.

Use as "python mbox_to_csv_converter.py test.mailbox test.csv " where "test.mailbox" is the mbox to convert and "test.csv" is the name you want to give to the .csv file.

This script is getting worked on when I need to perform a new backup again.
